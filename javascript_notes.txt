JavaScript Variables
Variables are "containers" for storing information.

JavaScript variables are used to hold values or expressions.

A variable can have a short name, like x, or a more descriptive name, like carname.
Rules for JavaScript variable names:

 Variable names are case sensitive (y and Y are two different variables)
 Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character

Note: Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, variable names are case-sensitive.
Example


A variable's value can change during the execution of a script. You can refer to a variable by its name to
display or change its value.


<html>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
var firstname;
firstname="Welcome";
document.write(firstname);
document.write("<br />");
firstname="XYZ";
document.write(firstname);
</script>
<p>The script above declares a variable,
assigns a value to it, displays the value, change the value,
and displays the value again.</p>
</body>
</html>
Output :


Welcome

XYZ

The script above declares a variable, assigns a value to it, displays the value, change the value, and
displays the value again
